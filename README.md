# BreakingBricks
Breaking Bricks is a small game program that designed by JavaScript based on Canvas element of HTML5. 2D visual shapes were implemented by the Canvas and through repetition of functions of creation and deletion, the movement of the figures was implemented. Some logics for collision of the ball and paddle, and concepts of the game were also used.

Move the paddle with using keyboard and keep bouncing the ball back until the bricks are all broken by the ball within 3 trials.
